Here the displacement demands are calculated using non-linear analysis and displacement capacities are ensured to allow those deformation demands. Displacement capacities are calculated using methods like capacity spectrum method, displacement coefficient method, etc.",

        title: "What is pushover analysis and how to perform it in ETABS?",
        preview: "This is part 2 of displacement based design approach. Pushover analysis means application of loads in steps. Loads are applied in steps because the stiffness of the member usually reduces at each step due to formation of cracks or plastic hinges. If the stiffness would not change along the way, this would be same as linear analysis. Pushover analysis helps to see the behavior of structure during earthquake, i.e. how the plasticity develops in it. It is one of the method of performance based design approach.",

In case of rigid diaphragm EQ loads are applied at CM of diaphragm whereas in no diaphragm and semi-rigid diaphragm, EQ loads are applied at each internally and externally meshed joint.",

Now the top plank is subjected to load P. As a result shear stress Ï„ is developed on interface. When the shear stress Ï„ exceeds strength of glue, then the planks get separated.",
